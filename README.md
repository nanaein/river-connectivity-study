Take main rivers if tributaries are in discarded rivers (i.e., they are not in a shapefile of NaturalEarth), then add up the frequency of the main rivers accordingly.
Connect the tributaries/ stretches to their main rivers which are already on the map (i.e., they are in a shapefile of NaturalEarth), but do not add up the frequency of the main river.
